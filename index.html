              <p>
                Have you ever seen ukiyoe paintings by one of the most world
                famous artists, Katsushika Hokusai and wished to view Mt. Fuji
                like him someday in Japan? Actually, our local town, Fujinomiya,
                located at the western foot of Mt. Fuji, is where many of the
                famous 36 Views of Mount Fuji and 100 Views of Mount Fuji were
                painted. In addition, unlike the Fuji Five Lakes and Hakone,
                where many tourists visit, our area still retains its authentic
                culture and ancient landscape. Visitors can walk through
                different villages, shrines and temples, view Mt. Fuji like
                Hokusai and draw Mt. Fuji with a Japanese brush (筆)like
                Hokusai. You can also enjoy staying the Hokusai-themed Japanese
                private house in the middle of a village by Fuji-Hakone-Izu
                National Park. There are many walking trails around the
                guesthouse, so this ecotour package is perfect for nature and
                culture walking lovers!

                Have you ever seen ukiyoe paintings by one of the most world
                famous artists, Katsushika Hokusai and wished to view Mt. Fuji
                like him someday in Japan? Actually, our local town, Fujinomiya,
                located at the western foot of Mt. Fuji, is where many of the
                famous 36 Views of Mount Fuji and 100 Views of Mount Fuji were
                painted. In addition, unlike the Fuji Five Lakes and Hakone,
                where many tourists visit, our area still retains its authentic
                culture and ancient landscape. You can walk through different
                villages, shrines and temples, view Mt. Fuji like Hokusai.

              100% recommended. We are a family of 4, including 2 teenagers of
              14 & 17yo. To quote our teenagers : "this was the best day so
              far". Our guide Chieko was full of resources, initiatives,
              anecdotes, that drove us to a great day and so many different
              genuine experiences: biking in the rice fields & woods, stopping
              at an eco-friendly house, visiting & eating at a fish farm,
              exploring a house of Sake production from A to Z, and discussing
              with her. In the end, she added another loop to fulfill one of our
              special and unplanned request. We would remember that day, thank
              you to all the protagonists of this wonderful experience! Guides
              and founders have traveled across the planet. They are full of
              anecdotes, led by an ideal philosophy, all items within the house
              has its story, everyone one was smiling and welcoming.

              We had a wonderful time here. Masa and his family (dog included)
              are so welcoming and lovely. The focus on ecotourism is clear and
              it's really interesting to learn about the culture and history of
              the area, as well as Hokusai (we stayed at the guest house and the
              many Hokusai-painted views of Fuji mean you can see the mountain
              even if there is a cloud!). We had some very tasty food, an e-bike
              tour and a wander up to a low peak of Fuji. Amazing, beautiful,
              ethical - highly recommended!

              Nous voyageons mes enfants de 18 et 15 ans et moi depuis 6 jours
              au Japon et c est notre meilleure journée . Nous rencontrons des
              artisans passionnés et qui sont d une gentillesse et d une
              générosité avec nous. Nous avons tellement envie de faire
              connaître leur cuisine des meilleures nouilles sautées du Japon
              deux années de suite et de spécialité cuite a la plancha, leur thé
              et plantation de thé vert, leurs kimonos, leur coûteaux de
              cuisine, a tous nos amis . Notre guide parlait anglais et français
              c'était génial ! Beaucoup d émotions positives et une journée
              illuminée malgré les nuages masquant le mont Fuji 🤗👍🥳

              Perfect relaxation spot outside the concrete jungle! After days of
              endless walking in the city, this is the best spot to spend
              leisurely time with the family before heading back to reality.
              Great service and very clean location. Will definitely recommend
              to friends and family. Rooms Rooms were very clean and tidy.
              Properly maintained. Wish we had more time to stay. Activities
              There’s biking, hiking, swimming, bon fire, badminton, waterfalls,
              restaurants and even shopping Safety Staff made sure we felt safe.
              Food & Drinks Great food, perfect for the campsight! Veggies are
              freshly picked from their own garden.

              against the perfect backdrop. Thank you for showing us around and
              for sharing the things you do to support ecotourism and your

              W3D2N glamping vacation with the family. Stunning views, right in
              front of Mt Fuji. The English-speaking guides, Chieko and Mari,
              were very friendly, helpful and hospitable right from the pickup
              to the various eco day trips along the way. The accommodation area
              is tucked away in the countryside of Fujinomiya. Access by public
              transport is difficult so Chieko picked us up from Shin Fuji
              station. It was clean and quiet. We had no problems with 2 young
              children with us too. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves during our
              time there! Highly recommended for anyone who loves the outdoors
              but with a good balance of "city area" living (e.g. hot water,
              coffee machine, WiFi, etc).

              Don't let the drive from the train station cloud your view of this
              amazing town. Our guide was brilliant – very knowledgeable,
              friendly, interesting – who introduced us to local craftspeople.
              No idea how else we could have met these people. It was money
              extremely well spent. When my wife and I travel we are much more
              interested in what local people are doing as opposed to walking
              through stuffy museums celebrating long-dead people. Our guide
              seemed to sense exactly what we wanted and she delivered 100
              percent.

              What an amazing experience!! A wonderful location right under Mt.
              Fuji. The team were exceptional hosts in every way. Accommodations
              were very comfortable. And the bike tour was the cherry on top. I
              would highly recommend staying here.

              The moment you step foot onto the property at Satoyama you are
              blown away, not only by the views but by the attention to detail.
              I stayed in the newly opened guest house but also had dinner by
              the fire at the glamping huts where the majestic Mt Fuji sits in
              full display from the front yard. The facilities at the glamping
              area are top notch with interior access to spotless private
              bathroom and shower, a lounge/coffee room and a kitchen with all
              the things you may need. An enclosed BBQ deck is also available
              for meals and the property itself features a pond and beautiful
              trees. The guest house is another level of luxury with every
              little detail of Japanese architecture making you feel like a
              member of the Emperors family. It is an expansive house with two
              toilets, a beautiful bath and shower, several vanity areas if you
              have a big family and several family rooms/coffee/lounge areas for
              relaxing. This is just down the road from the glamping area but
              still has great views of Mt Fuji and for a even couples looking
              for some extra space I could not recommend a more perfect place to
              stay.

                Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required
                to purchase travel insurance before the start of their trip.
                Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on
                the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature,
                availability and cost of health care around the world, travel
                insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every
                journey.

                Under current restrictions, a visa is required to enter Japan as
                a tourist. We recommend you apply for your visa no later than
                one month before your departure date. Please contact your local

                Tipping isn't customary in Japan and is not expected – in fact,
                it will sometimes be considered impolite. Some inns or ryokans

                Internet access is excellent in Japan, with one of the most
                developed high-speed internet networks in the world. Internet
                cafes and wi-fi hotspots are easily found in most cities and
                major towns.

                Mobile phone coverage is excellent in Japan but be aware that
                talking loudly on your phone in public places (like in train
                carriages) is frowned upon. You will be expected to hide your
                mouth behind your hand if you must take a call in public. If you
                want to use your mobile phone, ensure global roaming is
                activated before you arrive (but be aware of the fees this may
                incur).

                In Japan, toilets range from high-tech bidets to standard
                western-style flushable toilets to squat toilets, which are
                still common outside the city. Sometimes you may need to pay for
                toilet paper, which can usually be purchased from a vending
                machine nearby.

                Drinking water from taps in Japan is considered safe. For
                environmental reasons, try to use a refillable water bottle
                rather than buying bottled water. Major cities often have water
                fountains in train stations.

                Major credit cards are accepted by some stores; however, Japan
                is still very much a cash culture and as such, some places may
                not accept credit cards. Ensure you carry enough cash to cover
                purchases.

                March, April and May are excellent months to holiday in Japan
                and, as a result, are the busiest. The weather is usually fine
                and beautiful cherry blossoms are in full bloom. September,
                October and November are also great months to visit Japan on
                holidays, as the days are warm but not humid and the autumn
                colours are out. Winter, while cold, offers great conditions for
                skiing, snowboarding, going to snow festivals and admiring the
                stunning mountain scenery. The summer months can be quite humid,
                but tourist areas are generally quieter and there are many fun
                festivals and fireworks displays to enjoy.

                Spring (March to May): temperatures range from 10 to 20°C, with
                conditions getting sunnier and clearer towards the end of the
                season.
              </p>
              <p>
                Summer (June to August): temperatures range from 21 to 32°C
                depending on where you are. It’s warmer in the south than in the
                north. You can expect some rain in June, and it can get quite
                humid towards the end of the season.
              </p>
              <p>
                Autumn (September to November): temperatures range from 7 to
                20°C. The humidity starts to calm down in September, but days
                stay warm until October. Nights can be chilly.

                Winter (December to February): break out the coats, temperatures
                during winter range from 0 to 15°C. The mountains and the north
                experience snowfall.

                Japan is generally safe and is rated among the safest countries
                in the world. Reports of crime such as theft are very low and
                travellers are often stunned by the fact that locals leave

                don’t recommend it!).

                Summer months can be incredibly hot and sticky, so loose,
                lightweight and breathable clothing is essential.
              </p>
              <p>
                Spring and autumn can be crisp and cold, so you might want to
                pack thermal layers in addition to your coat and boots.
              </p>
              <p>
                Outside of Hokkaido and the mountains, the winter temperatures
                in Japan are manageable as long as you have regular cold-weather
                clothes like a good coat, pair of gloves, a winter hat and a
                scarf.
              </p>
              <p>
                The style of dress common for women in Japan may be a little
                more covered up than you are used to, particularly outside the
                major cities.

                Whether you’re a seasoned traveller or you’re about to embark on
                your first trip, travelling can be as intimidating as it is
                exciting. That's the beauty of a small group tour. From handling
                the logistics and organising amazing cultural activities to
                local leaders who know each destination like the back of their
                hand (like which street has the best markets and where to get
                the most authentic food), travelling on a small group tour with
                Intrepid will give you unforgettable travel experiences without
                the hassle that comes with exploring a new place. Plus, you'll
                have ready-made friends to share the journey with. All you have
                to do is turn up with a healthy sense of adventure and we’ll
                take care of the rest.
